1) Searching Through Text
	echo $HISTFILE --> show location of history file
	cat $HISTFILE --> show the list of commands you've executed in your shell
	
	grep man $HISTFILE --> search through this file for lines which containing the text "man"
	Alternative for grep man $HISTFILE, we can use: history command
		Ex: history | grep man
	

2) Using grep with Regular Expressions
	a) Find only lines that start with man
		history | grep "[0-9]\+  man" --> remember, before "man" have double space
		
		Note: prefer work with extended regexes
			history | grep -E "[0-9]+  man"
		or
			history | egrep "[0-9]+  man"
			
3) Advanced Grep Features
	a) Making a Search Case-Insensitive
		grep -i err ./logs/web-server-logs.txt
			note: -i: insensitive, find err in log file
			
	b) Getting Additional Context for Search Result
		grep host -A 3 ./programs/web-server/web-server.js
			-A: after parameter, prints a given number of lines after each line matching the search
		grep throw -B 5 ./programs/web-server/web-server.js
			-B: before parameter, print a specified number of lines that come before the match
		history | grep -C 5 'git init'
			-C: context parameter, provides a specified number of lines before and after each match
	
	c) Searching through Multiple Files
		grep -H -n ./logs/apm-logs/*.logs
			note: -H: show hearder (when search multiple files, if one file: header no show), -n: line number
		grep -r -H -n -i error ./logs
			note: -r: recursive, -i: insensitive
			We can write: grep -rHni ./logs/apm-logs/*.logs
	
	d) Filtering and Piping grep Output
		grep -v debug ./logs/web-server.logs
			-v: inverse, use to exclude something, here wanting to exclude lines that have "debug"
		
		grep -i error -r ./logs | grep -i -v memory | grep -i -v 'not found'
	
	e) Combing grep with other commands
		ps -a | grep vim --> filter the list to only vim processes
		grep -H -C 3 -R password ./k8s/**/*.yaml | less
		ls -l /usr/bin /bin /usr/local/bin | grep zip --> search through all of the installed programs for programs with zip
		history | grep grep | tail -n 10 --> show the last 10 grep commands entered in the shell
