1) Searching with find command
	Syntax: find option starting expression
	
	find ~/effective-shell --> list the full hierarchy of files and folders
	find /usr/bin /usr/sbin

2) Searching for Only Files or Folders
	find . -type f --> search only files
	find . -type d --> return only directories
	
3) Searching by File or Folder Name
	find . -name "simpsons-characters.txt"
	find . -name "*log*" --> find any file or folder has "log" in their name
	find . -name "log" --> find exact match for name log
	
	Note: the name must be exact and do not forget the quotes
	
4) Searching by Path
	find . -path "*apm-logs*"
	
5) Specifying More Than One Search Option
	And Expression
		find . -type f -name "*.logs"
	Or Expression
		find . -name "*.js" -or -name "*.html"
		
6) Running Case-Insensitive Searches
	find . -name "*.js" -or -name "*.Js" -or -name "*.js" -or name "*.JS"
	find . -iname "*.js"
	
	Note: you can use "-ipath" to run case-insensitive path searches
	
7) Grouping Parts of an Expression
	find . \( -name "*.js" -or -name "*.html" \) -a -path "*programs*"
	
	note: -a: and
	
8) Excluding Search Result with the NOT Operator
	find -name "*.js" -and -not -path "*program*"
	
9) Acting on Search Results
	a) Printing Paths
		find ~ -name "*.tmp" -print
		Note: no need "-print" since it's default behavior
		
	b) Deleting Files
		find ~ -name "*.tmp" -delete
		
	c) Executing Commands
		find ~/effective-shell -name "*.txt" -exec wc -w {} \;
		
		Note: exec tells find to execute a command on each result
			{}: replace for path of folders/files it finds
			\;: signify the end of the -exec command
			
		Since wc only works for files not folder, we can change a little bit
			find ~/effective-shell -type f -name "*.txt" -exec wc -w {} \;
	
	d) Confirming Commands Before Execution
		find ~/effective-shell -name "*.txt" -ok rm {} \;
		
		-ok: works just like -exec but ask for confirmation
		
10) Handling Symbolic Links
	find /bin: return /bin but /bin is the symlink to /usr/bin
		How: ls -l / /usr | grep bin
	find -L /bin: return what the symlinks are linked to (-L: follow links)
		Note: /bin here is the symlink to /usr/bin
		
11) Going Further with find
	a) Find Large Files
		find / -size +1G -size -500G
			note: -size test for search by file size that larger and 1G and smaller than 500G (not include)
			we can combine with exec or ok: find / -size +1G -size -500G -exec ls -lh {} \; --> really powerful
	
	b) Find recently modified files with -mtime, -mtime -2: modified in the last 2 days
		find . -not -path "*/\.*" -mtime -2		
	
	c) Find files that have had permissions changed
		find ~/.ssh -ctime -30 --> return files whose permissions have been changed in the past 30 days
		
	d) Find executable scripts and make them non-executable
		find ~ -perm /a=x -exec chmod -x {} +
		
		note: + --> find will pass all the files to chmod at the same time and execute it
	only once on the current set, rather than each file
	
	e) Find empty folders and remove them after confirmation
		find ~ -maxdepth 3 -type d -empty -ok -rmdir {} \;
		
		note: maxdepth 3 --> limit the search to only three folder deep
