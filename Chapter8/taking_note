1) Introducing xargs
	find . -empty --> find empty files
	find . -empty | rm --> does not work since rm does not actually read the list of files from stdin, pass it that list as a parameter
	
	find . -empty | xargs --> xargs takes the input, separates each line with a space, and passes the list of files to the echo command, echo will list out to the screen
	
	find . -empty | xargs echo rm --> xargs to pass the output to the echo command with rm as its first argument, write out rm followed by the list of files. Putting 'echo' before whatever command you want to run is useful way to check the command before running it
	
	find . -empty | xargs rm --> delete the list of files
	
2) Handling Whitespace, Special Characters, and Tracing
	find . -type f | xargs -t rm --> use the option -t ("trace") to show the command that xargs actually tried to run
	
	find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -t rm --> prevent xargs get confused when it sees spaces, tabs, quotes, newlines in filenames; -print0 means instead of printing results separated by newlines, it prints them separated by a null byte (\0) and -0 tells xargs that input is null-delimited, matching with -print0
	
3) Customizing How xargs Processes Input Lines
	find . -type f | xargs -L 1 echo --> -L flag uses for specify how many files xargs will process at one time, here is 1 file at a time
	
	find . -type f | xargs -L 3 echo --> -L 3 here means echo will run twice, processing three files the first time and the remaining two files the second time
