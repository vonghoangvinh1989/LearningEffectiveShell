1) Creating a Basic Shell Scripts
	a) Adding and Formatting Commands
		Script common.v1.sh
			# Inform the user of the output they can expect.
			echo "common commands:"

			# Show the most commonly used commands.
			tail ~/.bash_history -n 1000 
				| sort \
				| uniq -c \
				| sed 's/^ *//' \
				| sort -n -r \
				| head -n 10

		Explain: uniq -c --> -c option prefixes each unique line with the number of occurrences.
		         sed 's/^ *//' --> Removes leading spaces before the counts, for cleaner formatting.
		         sort -n -r --> Sorts numerically (-n) and in reverse order (-r), So the most frequently used commands appear first.
		         
		Note: history -c: clear
		      history -r: reload tells the shell to reload the history file so that your bash history
		      
	b) Pipelining Commands
		sh ~/scripts/common.v1.sh --> sh starts a new shell, sh run the script and then exits
	
	c) Making Shell Scripts Executable
		chmod +x ~/scripts/common.v1.sh
		
	d) Specifying What Program Should Run a Script
		#!/usr/bin/sh --> shebang tells the system what program it should use to run a script, here is sh
		
		env python3 --> we can use env to run python program, here is python3
		
		which env --> to confirm env (or can use 'which bash' to confirm the path of bash) in the system
			so we can write something as: #!/usr/bin/env sh 
		
	e) Sourcing Shell Scripts
		source ~/effective-shell/scripts/set_editor.sh --> loading the content into current shell session and running command there (another syntax is using dot notation (.) as '. ~/effective-shell/scripts/set_editor.sh'

2) Installing Scripts Locally
	sudo ln -s ~/scripts/common.v1.sh /usr/local/bin/common --> create symbolic link called common in /usr/local/bin folder
